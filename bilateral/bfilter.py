    Here we consider a signal $x$ having domain S in N-dimensional
    space and range R in C-dimensional space. The bilateral filtered
    signal $y$ at pixel location $p$ is given by

        y(p) = 1/w(p) \\sum_{q \\in S}w(q,p)I_q
        w(q,p) = G_s(|q-p|)G_c(|x_q-x_p|)
        w(p) = \\sum_{q \\in S}w(q,p)

    here $G_s$ and $G_c$ are unnormalized Gaussians with user defined
    variances.

    For the vectorized version we consider each contributing n-d shift $o$
    and compute

        y(p) = 1/w(p) \\sum_{o} w(p-o,p)I_{p-o}
        w(p-o,p) = G_s(|o|)G_c(|x_{p-o}-x_p|)
        w(p) = \\sum_{o} w(p-o,p)

    The contributing shifts are computed from the cut-off kernel size
    $k=2*ceil(3*sigma_space)+1$.

    This method is vectorized, but still slow for large sigma values,
    because it requires O(|S|*|k|^2) evaluations.

    While Gaussian filtering can be represented as a linear convolution
    with a fixed kernel, Bilateral filtern cannot as it a) requires
    a non-linear normalization factor and the range kernel depends
    on the actual signal values. See [1] for a linear formulation
    in a homogeneous space of higher dims.

    Params:
        x: (*,C) n-dimensional signal having C channels.
        sigma_space: standard deviation of Gaussian applied in
            space/domain dimensions
        sigma_channel: standard deviation of Gaussian applied in
            range dimension.
        k: optional kernel size. If not provided computed as
            2*ceil(3*sigma_space) + 1

    Returns:
        y: (*,C) filtered signal
